  abstract	= { <p>Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a numerical
		  method commonly used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
		  to simulate complex free-surface flows. Simulations with
		  this mesh-free particle method far exceed the capacity of a
		  single processor. In this paper, as part of a
		  dual-functioning code for either central processing units
		  (CPUs) or Graphics Processor Units (GPUs), a
		  parallelisation using GPUs is presented. The GPU
		  parallelisation technique uses the Compute Unified Device
		  Architecture (CUDA) of nVidia devices. Simulations with
		  more than one million particles on a single GPU card
		  exhibit speedups of up to two orders of magnitude over
		  using a single-core CPU. It is demonstrated that the code
		  achieves different speedups with different CUDA-enabled
		  GPUs. The numerical behaviour of the SPH code is validated
		  with a standard benchmark test case of dam break flow
		  impacting on an obstacle where good agreement with the
		  experimental results is observed. Both the achieved
		  speed-ups and the quantitative agreement with experiments
		  suggest that CUDA-based GPU programming can be used in SPH
		  methods with efficiency and reliability.</p> },

  abstract	= {In the last years design procedures of urban drainage
		  systems have shifted from end of pipe design criteria to
		  ambient water quality approaches requiring integrated
		  models of the system for evaluation of measures. Emphasis
		  is put on the improvement of the receiving water quality
		  and the overall management of river basins, which is a core
		  element of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well.
		  Typically, it is not necessary to model the whole variety
		  of effects on the receiving water but to focus on the few
		  dominating ones. Only pollutants and processes that have a
		  direct and significant influence on the selected impacts
		  need to be described quantitatively, whereas all other
		  processes can be neglected. Hence, pragmatism is required
		  to avoid unnecessary complexity of integrated models. This
		  is as well true for software being used in daily
		  engineering work, requiring simplicity in handling and a
		  certain flexibility to be adjusted for different scenarios.
		  CITY DRAIN Â© was developed to serve these needs. Therefore
		  it was developed in the Matlab/Simulink Â© environment,
		  enabling a block wise modelling of the different parts of
		  the urban drainage system (catchment, sewer system, storage
		  devises, receiving water, etc.). Each block represents a
		  system element (subsystem) with different underlying
		  modelling approaches for hydraulics and mass transport. The
		  different subsystems can be freely arranged and connected
		  to each other in order to describe an integrated urban
		  drainage system. The open structure of the software allows
		  to add own blocks and/or modify blocks (and underlying
		  models) according to the specific needs. The application of
		  CITY DRAIN is shown within the integrated modelling case
		  study Vils/Reutte. Further additional applications for CITY
		  DRAIN, including batch simulations, real time control (RTC)
		  and model based predictive control (MBPC) are presented and
		  discussed.},

  abstract	= {This paper deals with the sensitivity of distributed
		  hydrological models to different patterns that account for
		  the spatial distribution of rainfall: spatially averaged
		  rainfall or rainfall field. The rainfall data come from a
		  dense network of recording rain gauges that cover
		  approximately 2000Â km2 around Mexico City. The reference
		  rain sample accounts for the 50 most significant events,
		  whose mean duration is about 10Â h and maximal point depth
		  170Â mm. Three models were tested using different runoff
		  production models: storm-runoff coefficient, complete or
		  partial interception. These models were then applied to
		  four fictitious homogeneous basins, whose sizes range from
		  20 to 1500Â km2. For each test, the sensitivity of the
		  model is expressed as the relative differences between the
		  empirical distribution of the peak flows (and runoff
		  volumes), calculated according to the two patterns of
		  rainfall input: uniform or non-uniform. Differences in
		  flows range from 10 to 80%, depending on the type of runoff
		  production model used, the size of the basin and the return
		  period of the event. The differences are generally moderate
		  for extreme events. In the local context, this means that
		  uniform design rainfall combining point rainfall
		  distribution and the probabilistic concept of the areal
		  reduction factor could be sufficient to estimate major
		  flood probability. Differences are more significant for
		  more frequent events. This can generate problems in
		  calibrating the hydrological model when spatial rainfall
		  localization is not taken into account: a bias in the
		  estimation of parameters makes their physical
		  interpretation difficult and leads to overestimation of
		  extreme flows.},

		  two small ungauged catchments, it was found that the
		  uncertainty in the description of the rainfall was
		  generally the most important contributor to the overall
		  uncertainty, followed by the uncertainty in the description
		  of the surface runoff. In the evaluation of the extreme
		  discharges of chemical oxygen demand (COD) from combined

		  was found to be the dominant factor. If the sewer system is

		  In this comment it is shown that the formal Bayesian
		  identification of models is a special case of GLUE that can
		  be used where the modeller is prepared to make very strong
		  assumptions about the nature of the modelling errors. For
		  the hypothetical study of Mantovan and Todini, exact
		  assumptions were assumed known for the formal Bayesian
		  identification, but were then ignored in the application of
		  GLUE to the same data. We show that a more reasonable
		  application of GLUE to this problem using similar prior
		  knowledge shows that gives equally coherent results to the
		  formal Bayes identification. In real applications, subject
		  to input and model structural error it is suggested that
		  the coherency condition of MT06 cannot hold at the single
		  observation level and that the choice of a formal Bayesian
		  likelihood function may then be incoherent. In these (more
		  interesting) cases, GLUE can be coherent in the application
		  of likelihood measures based on blocks of data, but
		  different choices of measures and blocks effectively
		  represent different beliefs about the information content
		  of data in real applications with input and model
		  structural errors.},

		  [Mantovan, P., Todini, E., 2006. Hydrological forecasting

		  methodology. J. Hydrol. 330, 368-381]. It is shown that the

		  including model structural error, their strong definition
		  of coherence is shown to be inapplicable to the extent that
		  the choice of a formal likelihood function based on a
		  simple error structure may be an incoherent choice. It is
		  demonstrated by some relatively minor modifications of
		  their hypothetical example that misspecification of the
		  error model and the non-stationarities associated with the
		  presence of input error and model structural error in the
		  Bayes approach will then produce well-defined but incorrect
		  parameter distributions. This empirical result is quite
		  independent of GLUE, but the flexibility of the GLUE
		  approach may then prove to be an advantage in providing
		  more coherent and robust choices of model evaluation in
		  these cases and, by analogy, in other non-ideal cases for
		  real applications. At the current time it is difficult to
		  make a reasoned choice between methods of uncertainty
		  estimation for real applications because of a lack of
		  understanding of the real information content of data in

		  environmental systems that there are many different model
		  structures and many different parameter sets within a

		  acceptable in reproducing the observed behaviour of that
		  system. This has been called the equifinality concept. The
		  generalised likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE)
		  methodology for model identification allowing for
		  equifinality is described. Prediction within this
		  methodology is a process of ensemble forecasting using a
		  sample of parameter sets from the behavioural model space,
		  with each sample weighted according to its likelihood
		  measure to estimate prediction quantiles. This allows that
		  different models may contribute to the ensemble prediction
		  interval at different time steps and that the
		  distributional form of the predictions may change over
		  time. Any effects of model nonlinearity, covariation of
		  parameter values and errors in model structure, input data
		  or observed variables, with which the simulations are
		  compared, are handled implicitly within this procedure.
		  GLUE involves a number of choices that must be made
		  explicit and can be therefore subjected to scrutiny and
		  discussion. These include ways of combining information
		  from different types of model evaluation or from different
		  periods in a data assimilation context. An example
		  application to rainfall-runoff modelling is used to

  abstract	= {A large-scale column study was conducted in Melbourne,
		  Australia, to test the performance of stormwater biofilters
		  for the removal of sediment, nitrogen and phosphorus. The
		  aim of the study was to provide guidance on the optimal
		  design for reliable treatment performance. A variety of
		  factors were tested, using 125 large columns: plant
		  species, filter media, filter depth, filter area and
		  pollutant inflow concentration. The results demonstrate
		  that vegetation selection is critical to performance for
		  nitrogen removal (e.g. Carex appressa and Melaleuca
		  ericifolia performed significantly better than other tested
		  species). Whilst phosphorus removal was consistently very
		  high (typically around 85%), biofilter soil media with
		  added organic matter reduced the phosphorus treatment
		  effectiveness. Biofilters built according to observed
		  [`]optimal specifications' can reliably remove both
		  nutrients (up to 70% for nitrogen and 85% for phosphorus)
		  and suspended solids (consistently over 95%). The optimally
		  designed biofilter is at least 2% of its catchment area and
		  possesses a sandy loam filter media, planted with C.
		  appressa or M. ericifolia. Further trials will be required
		  to test a wider range of vegetation, and to examine
		  performance over the longer term. Future work will also
		  examine biofilter effectiveness for treatment of heavy
		  metals and pathogens.},

  abstract	= {Large environmental simulation models are usually
		  overparameterized with respect to given sets of
		  observations. This results in poorly identifiable or
		  nonidentifiable model parameters. For small models, plots
		  of sensitivity functions have proven to be useful for the
		  analysis of parameter identifiability. For models with many
		  parameters, however, near-linear dependence of sensitivity
		  functions can no longer be assessed graphically. In this
		  paper a systematic approach for tackling the parameter
		  identifiability problem of large models based on local
		  sensitivity analysis is presented. The calculation of two
		  identifiability measures that are easy to handle and
		  interpret is suggested. The first accounts for the
		  sensitivity of model results to single parameters, and the
		  second accounts for the degree of near-linear dependence of
		  sensitivity functions of parameter subsets. It is shown how
		  these measures provide identifiability diagnosis for
		  parameter subsets, how they are able to guide the selection
		  of identifiable parameter subsets for parameter estimation,
		  and how they facilitate the interpretation of the
		  correlation matrix of the parameter estimate with respect
		  to parameter identifiability. In addition, we show how
		  potential bias of the parameter estimates, due to a priori
		  fixing of some of the parameters, can be analyzed. Finally,
		  two case studies are presented in order to illustrate the
		  suggested approach.},

  abstract	= {We diagnose the manner with which rainfall input and
		  parametric uncertainty influence the character of the flow
		  simulation uncertainty in a validated distributed
		  hydrologic model. An extensive Monte Carlo numerical
		  experiment was undertaken for several study watersheds in
		  the southern Central Plains of the United States. It
		  examined the sensitivity of ensemble flow simulations
		  produced by the distributed model HRCDHM to uncertainty in
		  parametric and radar rainfall input. The watersheds are
		  associated with the Distributed Model Intercomparison
		  Project (DMIP) organized by the US National Weather Service
		  Office of Hydrologic Development. The model validated well
		  in DMIP both for watershed outlets and interior points on
		  various scales with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.6-0.9
		  for hourly flow simulations [J. Hydrol. (2004) 14504, this
		  issue], and we expect that the qualitative nature of the
		  results of this study are of greater applicability than for
		  this model alone. The uncertainty scenarios included:
		  parametric uncertainty involving multiple soil model
		  parameters simultaneously, routing model parameter
		  uncertainty, rainfall uncertainty under two different error
		  distributions, and combined uncertainty in both parameters
		  and input. The flow sensitivities are summarized in terms
		  of a relative measure of the dispersion in the flow
		  ensembles computed for each event, and for several
		  watershed locations consisting of the watershed outlet and
		  additional interior locations. The results consistently
		  show that the flow simulation uncertainty is strongly
		  dependent on catchment scale for all cases of prescribed
		  parametric and radar-rainfall input uncertainty. Simulation
		  uncertainty is significantly reduced for larger scales of
		  distributed model resolution. The consistency of this
		  result across the selected watershed locations allows for
		  the development of scaling relationships between catchment
		  size and the flow uncertainty measure. The derived scaling
		  relationship may be used to infer pronounced small-scale
		  simulation uncertainties in distributed hydrologic model
		  applications. Several fruitful future research directions
		  are identified including the incorporation of model
		  structure uncertainty in the analysis.},

		  the hydrologic and erosion behavior depends, to a large

		  rainfall are often discussed without due regard to any
		  resulting improvement in watershed modeling. Thus, there is
		  a real need for streamlining raingauge networks in order to
		  reflect rainfall variability and its effect on the
		  prediction of water, sediment and nutrient fluxes at the
		  watershed scale. In this study, such an impact was analyzed
		  using 9-year data collected at the outlets of two
		  watersheds encompassing a range of climates, surface areas
		  and environmental conditions. The Soil and Water Assessment
		  Tool (SWAT) was applied using as input data that collected
		  from 1 to 15 precipitation gauges per watershed. At both
		  sites the highest densities of raingauges were used for
		  SWAT calibration. The differences between the highest gauge
		  concentration and lower concentrations used for the
		  estimation of sediment loads led to the conclusion that a
		  high gauge concentration is necessary. At both watersheds,
		  predictions using rainfall records from the national
		  service stations produced inaccurate estimations. This was
		  probably because the gauge concentration was too sparse.
		  Finally, the general applicability of these results is
		  proposed by displaying the possibilities of extrapolation
		  to other watersheds or models.},

		  The existing models are very limited, particularly for
		  urban runoff conditions (i.e. low concentrations of fine
		  sediment). A laboratory investigation was carried-out
		  aiming at development of a new method for assessment of
		  sediment transport in non-submerged, steady, and uniform
		  flow through grass for low to moderate concentrations of
		  fine sediment. Two groups of experiments were conducted in
		  order to study sediment deposition and detachment in
		  controlled environment, named as the [`]deposition' and the
		  [`]detachment' experiments, respectively. Artificial turf
		  (Astroturf) was used to simulate natural grass, where no
		  infiltration was allowed. Experiments were conducted for
		  different flume slopes, grass densities, flow rates,
		  sediment inflows, and sediment densities. Concentration and
		  size of particles in the flow along the grass strip were
		  monitored. During 21 deposition experiments, it was
		  observed that concentration of sediment in runoff decreases
		  exponentially with the distance down the strip, where small
		  particles travel much further than coarse ones. During 4
		  detachment experiments, it was found that sediment
		  detachment is negligible compared to deposition. The
		  Kentucky model, developed mainly for rural runoff
		  conditions, failed to assess the measured sediment
		  transport rates. Dimensional analysis was carried out to
		  establish the main non-dimensional parameters for
		  assessment of particle trapping in grass. Using the results
		  of this analysis and the laboratory data a new simplified
		  relationship was established between particle fall number
		  and percentage of particles trapped in the grass.},

		  Despite this, relatively few controlled studies have been

		  focuses on field performance of grass filters in removal of
		  total suspended solids (TSS) from overland flow, and
		  verification of TRAVA, a model of sediment behaviour in
		  grass filters (published earlier in Deletic, A., 2001.

		  2005. Sediment behaviour in runoff over grassed surfaces.
		  Journal of Hydrology 301, 108-122). Limited nutrient
		  removal data were collected, at one of the field sites. The
		  paper presents results from controlled field tests
		  undertaken on a grass filter strip in Aberdeen, Scotland,
		  and a grass swale in Brisbane, Australia. In both studies
		  TSS concentrations were recorded along the grass, for
		  artificial inflow of water and sediment of different flow
		  rates and sediment concentrations. In the Aberdeen study
		  the emphasis was on performance in relation to different
		  sediment particle sizes, while for the Brisbane swale,
		  treatment performance for total nitrogen (TN), and total
		  phosphorus (TP) were also recorded. Both experimental
		  programmes had an unsteady input of pollutants. The
		  Aberdeen strip reduced sediment inflow concentrations by
		  61-86%, whilst the Brisbane swale removed an average of 69,
		  46, and 56% of the total loads of TSS, TP and TN,
		  respectively. TRAVA was used to model both the strip and
		  swale. For the Aberdeen strip, the differences between the
		  measured and modelled sediment loading rates were within
		  Â±25% of measured. Modelled concentrations in outflow from
		  the Brisbane swale were within Â±17% of measured. The
		  predicted mass of total sediment removed during experiments
		  was within Â±50% of measured for the Aberdeen strip and
		  Â±11% for the Brisbane swale. TRAVA is therefore shown to
		  be a reliable tool for prediction of the performance of
		  grass filters used for stormwater treatment.},

		  Different gridding algorithms are evaluated, the gains in
		  efficiency obtained from reordering of particles is
		  investigated and the cell-linked list and Verlet list
		  methods are studied to create the neighbour list.
		  Furthermore, an innovative searching procedure based on a
		  dynamic updating of the Verlet list is proposed. The
		  efficiency of the algorithms is analyzed in terms of

		  Model calibration and sensitivity analysis of such models

		  sensitivity of stormwater models with different levels of
		  complexities, using the formal Bayesian approach. The
		  rather complex MUSIC and simple KAREN models were compared
		  in terms of predicting catchment runoff, while an empirical
		  regression model was compared to a process-based
		  build-up/wash-off model for stormwater pollutant
		  prediction. A large dataset was collected at five
		  catchments of different land-uses in Melbourne, Australia.
		  In general, results suggested that, once calibrated, the
		  rainfall/runoff models performed similarly and were both
		  able to reproduce the measured data. It was found that the
		  effective impervious fraction is the most important
		  parameter in both models while both were insensitive to dry
		  weather related parameters. The tested water quality models
		  poorly represented the observed data, and both resulted in
		  high levels of parameter uncertainty.},

  abstract	= {Urban drainage models are important tools used by both
		  practitioners and scientists in the field of stormwater
		  management. These models are often conceptual and usually
		  require calibration using local datasets. The
		  quantification of the uncertainty associated with the
		  models is a must, although it is rarely practiced. The
		  International Working Group on Data and Models, which works
		  under the IWA/IAHR Joint Committee on Urban Drainage, has
		  been working on the development of a framework for defining
		  and assessing uncertainties in the field of urban drainage
		  modelling. A part of that work is the assessment and
		  comparison of different techniques generally used in the
		  uncertainty assessment of the parameters of water models.
		  This paper compares a number of these techniques: the
		  Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE), the
		  Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA),
		  an approach based on a multi-objective auto-calibration (a
		  multialgorithm, genetically adaptive multi-objective
		  method, AMALGAM) and a Bayesian approach based on a
		  simplified Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (implemented in
		  the software MICA). To allow a meaningful comparison among
		  the different uncertainty techniques, common criteria have
		  been set for the likelihood formulation, defining the
		  number of simulations, and the measure of uncertainty
		  bounds. Moreover, all the uncertainty techniques were
		  implemented for the same case study, in which the same
		  stormwater quantity and quality model was used alongside
		  the same dataset. The comparison results for a well-posed
		  rainfall/runoff model showed that the four methods provide
		  similar probability distributions of model parameters, and
		  model prediction intervals. For ill-posed water quality
		  model the differences between the results were much wider;
		  and the paper provides the specific advantages and
		  disadvantages of each method. In relation to computational
		  efficiency (i.e. number of iterations required to generate
		  the probability distribution of parameters), it was found
		  that SCEM-UA and AMALGAM produce results quicker than GLUE
		  in terms of required number of simulations. However, GLUE
		  requires the lowest modelling skills and is easy to
		  implement. All non-Bayesian methods have problems with the
		  way they accept behavioural parameter sets, e.g. GLUE,
		  SCEM-UA and AMALGAM have subjective acceptance thresholds,
		  while MICA has usually problem with its hypothesis on
		  normality of residuals. It is concluded that modellers
		  should select the method which is most suitable for the
		  system they are modelling (e.g. complexity of the model?s
		  structure including the number of parameters), their
		  skill/knowledge level, the available information, and the
		  purpose of their study.},

		  of viscous stress terms in smoothed particle hydrodynamics
		  (SPH). In this work, the existing methods are investigated
		  systematically and evaluated for a range of Reynolds
		  numbers using Poiseuille channel and lid-driven cavity test
		  cases. The best results are obtained using two methods
		  based on combinations of finite difference and SPH
		  approximations, due to Morris et al. and Cleary. Gradients
		  of high-valued functions are shown to be inaccurately
		  estimated with standard SPH. A method that reduces the
		  value of functions (in particular, pressure) before
		  calculating the gradients reduces this inaccuracy and is
		  shown to improve performance. A mode of instability in
		  Poiseuille channel flows, also reported in other works, is
		  examined and a qualitative explanation is proposed. The
		  choice of boundary implementation is shown to have a
		  significant effect on transient velocity profiles in
		  start-up of the flow. The use of at least linear
		  extrapolation for in-wall velocities is shown to be
		  preferable to mirroring of velocities. Consistency
		  corrections to the kernel are also found to result in
		  significant accuracy and stability improvements with most
		  methods, though not in all cases. Copyright Â© 2008 John

		  their resistance to erosion. However, only few models take
		  sewer sediments into account considering their rheological
		  properties. In the present paper different sewer sediment
		  erosion models have been tested and their uncertainties
		  have been assessed. The main goal was to discriminate the
		  algorithms with respect to their robustness and the
		  reduction of uncertainty. In order to accomplish such
		  objective the GLUE methodology has been used. The model has
		  been tested using the quantity-quality data gathered for
		  the Fossolo catchment (Bologna, Italy). Results show a
		  general tendency of sewer sediment erosion models to become

		  physical processes thus increasing modelling uncertainty.},

		  using three different methods: the Bayesian Monte Carlo
		  method, the GLUE pseudo-Bayesian method and the GLUE method
		  revised by means of a formal distribution of residuals
		  between the model and measured data (GLUE_f). The
		  uncertainty assessment of the models enabled evaluation of
		  the advantages and limitations of the three methodologies
		  adopted. The models were then tested using the
		  quantity-quality data gathered for the Fossolo catchment in
		  Bologna, Italy. The results revealed that all of the models
		  evaluated here provided good calibration results, even if
		  the model reliability (in terms of related uncertainty)
		  varied, which suggests the adoption of a specific modelling
		  approach with respect to the others. Additionally, a
		  comparison of uncertainty analysis approaches showed that,
		  regarding the models evaluated here, the classical Bayesian
		  method is more effective at discriminating models according
		  to their uncertainty, but the GLUE approach performs
		  similarly when it is based on the same founding assumptions
		  as the Bayesian method.},

  abstract	= {Summary Over the last few years, the use of mathematical
		  models has gained importance in urban drainage system
		  management; indeed, such models enable the combined
		  analysis of different components that constitute a drainage
		  system; the sewer system, wastewater treatment plant and
		  the receiving water body. The effectiveness of an
		  integrated approach has been widely demonstrated in the
		  past and is presented in the EU Water Framework Directive,
		  which also introduces a new point of view regarding the
		  water quality management of the whole system, requiring a
		  global analysis at the river basin scale for pollutant
		  sources. However, integrated urban drainage models
		  introduce several uncertain factors that are due to the
		  high complexity level of the adopted approaches as well as
		  to the lack of data for a robust model calibration. This
		  paper presents the uncertainty assessment of an integrated
		  urban drainage model developed in previous studies by means
		  of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation
		  methodology. The analysis has been applied to an
		  experimental catchment in Bologna (Italy) which covers a
		  part of the Bologna sewer network and a reach of the Savena
		  River.},

  number	= {2-3},
  abstract	= {With the rise of new powerful statistical techniques and
		  tools, the development of predictive habitat distribution
		  models has rapidly increased in ecology. Such models are
		  static and probabilistic in nature, since they
		  statistically relate the geographical distribution of
		  species or communities to their present environment. A wide
		  array of models has been developed to cover aspects as
		  diverse as biogeography, conservation biology, climate
		  change research, and habitat or species management. In this
		  paper, we present a review of predictive habitat
		  distribution modeling. The variety of statistical
		  techniques used is growing. Ordinary multiple regression
		  and its generalized form (GLM) are very popular and are
		  often used for modeling species distributions. Other
		  methods include neural networks, ordination and
		  classification methods, Bayesian models, locally weighted
		  approaches (e.g. GAM), environmental envelopes or even
		  combinations of these models. The selection of an
		  appropriate method should not depend solely on statistical
		  considerations. Some models are better suited to reflect
		  theoretical findings on the shape and nature of the
		  species' response (or realized niche). Conceptual
		  considerations include e.g. the trade-off between
		  optimizing accuracy versus optimizing generality. In the
		  field of static distribution modeling, the latter is mostly
		  related to selecting appropriate predictor variables and to
		  designing an appropriate procedure for model selection. New
		  methods, including threshold-independent measures (e.g.
		  receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-plots) and
		  resampling techniques (e.g. bootstrap, cross-validation)
		  have been introduced in ecology for testing the accuracy of
		  predictive models. The choice of an evaluation measure
		  should be driven primarily by the goals of the study. This
		  may possibly lead to the attribution of different weights
		  to the various types of prediction errors (e.g. omission,
		  commission or confusion). Testing the model in a wider
		  range of situations (in space and time) will permit one to
		  define the range of applications for which the model
		  predictions are suitable. In turn, the qualification of the
		  model depends primarily on the goals of the study that
		  define the qualification criteria and on the usability of
		  the model, rather than on statistics alone.},

		  including, light, nutrients and temperature. A technique

		  suggested that 8 out of 12 parameters were significant in

		  however there is a general lack of performance data for
		  these systems, particularly at the field scale. The
		  objective of this study was to investigate the hydrologic
		  and pollutant removal performance of three field-scale
		  biofiltration systems in two different climates. Biofilters
		  were shown to effectively attenuate peak runoff flow rates
		  by at least 80%. Performance assessment of a lined
		  biofilter demonstrated that retention of inflow volumes by
		  the filter media, for subsequent loss via
		  evapotranspiration, reduced runoff volumes by 33% on
		  average. Retention of water was found to be most influenced
		  by inflow volumes, although only small to medium storms
		  could be assessed. Vegetation was shown to be important for
		  maintaining hydraulic capacity, because root growth and
		  senescence countered compaction and clogging. Suspended
		  solids and heavy metals were effectively removed,
		  irrespective of the design configuration, with load
		  reductions generally in excess of 90%. In contrast,
		  nutrient retention was variable, and ranged from consistent
		  leaching to effective and reliable removal, depending on
		  the design. To ensure effective removal of phosphorus, a
		  filter medium with a low phosphorus content should be
		  selected. Nitrogen is more difficult to remove because it
		  is highly soluble and strongly influenced by the variable
		  wetting and drying regime that is inherent in biofilter
		  operation. The results of this research suggest that
		  reconfiguration of biofilter design to manage the
		  deleterious effects of drying on biological activity is
		  necessary to ensure long term nitrogen removal.},

		  from large catchments. Two conceptual continuous pathogen
		  models have been developed and evaluated using E. coli as a
		  pathogen indicator. The first model, the EG model,
		  describes surface and subsurface pathogen transport
		  processes by means of wash-off and loss equations. It is
		  coupled to an existing hydrologic model (SimHyd) that
		  predicts flows. The second model, named ASP, takes into
		  account only surface pathogen transport processes. It is
		  coupled to a stormflow-baseflow separation model, and
		  therefore is simpler than EG. The models have been tested
		  against baseflow and storm event E. coli concentrations
		  measured at three dissimilar catchments from southern
		  Australia. The prediction of pathogen peak concentrations
		  by the EG model was reasonably good; the coefficient of
		  correlation between the measured and modelled pathogen
		  peaks for all three catchments was r2Â =Â 0.93. However,
		  the ASP model was not able to model the peaks well
		  (r2Â =Â 0.54). The prediction of pathogen loads was
		  significantly better with r2Â =Â 0.95 for the EG model and
		  r2Â =Â 0.89 for the ASP model. It was concluded that a
		  slightly more complex EG model was performing better than
		  the oversimplified ASP model.},

  abstract	= {Summary A conceptual model of microbial behaviour in
		  catchments coupled with a standard hydrological model,
		  known as the EG model, has been previously developed and
		  tested for Escherichia coli. Due to the unavailability of
		  pathogen data, E. coli has been used as a pathogen
		  indicator. However, the model uses a broad conceptual
		  approach and therefore should be tested for other microbes
		  in future. This paper presents work done on sensitivity of
		  the EG model, as well as its further refinement.
		  Sensitivity of the model results to all E. coli calibration
		  parameters was carried out. The EG model was then tested
		  for its sensitivity to the number of events used to
		  calibrate the model. The data collected at three different
		  Australian drinking water catchments were used. Of the four
		  parameters in the E. coli component of the EG model, two
		  proved to be insensitive while the other two proved to be
		  important. The sensitive parameters were the coefficients
		  associated with the [`]wash-off' functions in the model,
		  while the two insensitive coefficients were associated with
		  the E. coli decay functions in the model. However, the
		  model became more sensitive towards the decay parameters in
		  cleaner catchments. This indicates that the hydrologic
		  aspects of the E. coli transport processes dominate rather
		  than the E. coli decay functions. Apart from one catchment
		  (that was partly urbanised and much smaller than the other
		  two), the model was successfully calibrated using a small
		  number of monitored events. It was concluded that the EG
		  model could be simplified further by not modelling the
		  decay of the pathogen indicator, E. coli.},

  abstract	= {The privatisation of the UK water sector in 1989
		  fundamentally altered the risk landscape. Where previously
		  it was the government's responsibility to ensure that water
		  supply met demand, that quality met standards and that the
		  environment was not harmed, now there is a complex
		  landscape within which risks are managed by a variety of
		  stakeholders. The problem is that water management is an
		  inherently risky business, where although it is in the
		  interest of most stakeholders to minimise the risk of water
		  supply failure it is not the responsibility of most
		  stakeholders. It is not, for example, either in the
		  interest of, or the responsibility of, natural ecosystems
		  to minimise the risk of water supply failure. This paper
		  explores the changing nature of risk allocation and
		  distribution in the management of domestic water supply
		  security in England and Wales. In so doing, it examines the
		  extent to which the institutional arrangements under the
		  British model of privatisation have facilitated a risk
		  redistribution culture in the event that `things go
		  wrong'.},

  abstract	= {The majority of environmental models require calibration
		  of some or all of their parameters before meaningful
		  predictions of catchment behaviour can be made. Despite the
		  importance of reliable parameter estimates, there are
		  growing concerns about the ability of objective-based
		  inference methods to adequately calibrate environmental
		  models. The problem lies with the formulation of the
		  objective or likelihood function, which is currently
		  implemented using essentially ad-hoc methods. We outline
		  limitations of current calibration methodologies, including
		  least squares, multi-objective, GLUE and Kalman filter
		  schemes and introduce a more systematic Bayesian Total
		  Error Analysis (BATEA) framework for environmental model
		  calibration and validation. BATEA imposes a hitherto
		  missing rigour in environmental modelling by requiring the
		  specification of physically realistic uncertainty models
		  with explicit assumptions that can and must be tested
		  against available evidence. Distinguishing between the
		  various sources of errors will reduce the current ambiguity
		  about parameter and predictive uncertainty and enable
		  rational testing of environmental model hypotheses. A
		  synthetic study demonstrates that explicitly accounting for
		  forcing errors leads to immediate advantages over
		  traditional least squares methods that ignore rainfall
		  history corruption and do not directly address the sources
		  of uncertainty in the calibration. We expect that
		  confronting all sources of uncertainty, including data and
		  model errors, will force fundamental shifts in the model
		  calibration/verification philosophy.},

  abstract	= " In order to successfully calibrate an urban drainage
		  model, multiple criteria should be considered, which raises
		  the issue of adopting a method for comparing different
		  parameter sets according to a set of objectives.
		  Multi-objective genetic algorithms (MOGA) have proved
		  effective in numerous such applications, where most of the
		  techniques relying on the condition of Pareto efficiency to
		  compare different solutions. However, as the number of
		  criteria increases, the ratio of Pareto optimal to feasible
		  solutions increases as well, worsening the efficiency of
		  the genetic algorithm search. In this paper, firstly the
		  drawbacks of single objective calibration approach are
		  highlighted. Then, a new MOGA, the preference ordering
		  genetic algorithm, is proposed, that alleviates the
		  drawbacks of conventional Pareto-based methods. The
		  efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated on the
		  calibration of a physically-based, distributed sewer
		  network model, and the comparison is made with a known MOGA
		  NSGA-II. The results are very encouraging because the
		  obtained parameter sets closely resembled both calibration
		  and validation events. The identifiability of 10 model
		  parameters were analysed, showing significantly smaller
		  ranges of optimal values for parameters related to
		  impervious areas compared to those related to pervious
		  areas, which is reasonable considering relatively low
		  rainfall intensities. In addition to standard ways of
		  presenting calibration results, ``radar'' plots were also
		  used to present information on trade-off for eight
		  objective functions for four rainfall-runoff events."

		  an accurate calibration is indispensable. In addition to
		  all sources of uncertainties in data collection due to the
		  measurement methods itself, it is a key question which data
		  has to be collected to calibrate a hydrological model, how
		  long measurement campaigns should last and where that data
		  has to be collected in a spatial distributed system as it
		  is neither possible nor sensible to measure the complete
		  system characteristics. In this paper we address this
		  question by means of stochastic modelling. Using Monte
		  Carlo Simulation different calibration strategies
		  (selection of measurement sites, selection of
		  rainfall-events) and different calibration parameters
		  (overflow volume, number of overflows) are tested, in order
		  to evaluate the influence on predicting the total overflow
		  volume of the entire system. This methodology is applied in
		  a case study with the aim to calculate the combined sewer
		  overflow (CSO) efficiency. It can be shown that a
		  distributed hydrological model can be calibrated
		  sufficiently when calibration is done on 30% of all
		  existing CSOs based on long-term observation. Event based
		  calibration is limited possible to a limited extend when
		  calibration events are selected carefully as wrong
		  selection of calibration events can result in a complete
		  failure of the calibration exercise.},

  abstract	= {To simulate hydrological models of combined sewer systems
		  an accurate calibration is indispensable. In addition to
		  all sources of uncertainties in data collection due to the
		  measurement methods itself, it is a key question which data
		  has to be collected to calibrate a hydrological model, how
		  long measurement campaigns should last and where that data
		  has to be collected in a spatial distributed system as it
		  is neither possible nor sensible to measure the complete
		  system characteristics. In this paper we address this
		  question by means of stochastic modelling. Using Monte
		  Carlo Simulation different calibration strategies
		  (selection of measurement sites, selection of
		  rainfall-events) and different calibration parameters
		  (overflow volume, number of overflows) are tested, in order
		  to evaluate the influence on predicting the total overflow
		  volume of the entire system. This methodology is applied in
		  a case study with the aim to calculate the combined sewer
		  overflow (CSO) efficiency. It can be shown that a
		  distributed hydrological model can be calibrated
		  sufficiently when calibration is done on 30% of all
		  existing CSOs based on long-term observation. Event based
		  calibration is limited possible to a limited extend when
		  calibration events are selected carefully as wrong
		  selection of calibration events can result in a complete
		  failure of the calibration exercise.},

  abstract	= {In a crude conceptual approach it is commonly assumed that
		  in a combined sewer system the concentration of dissolved
		  compounds is diluted by an increasing flow rate due to
		  rainwater inflow. However, theory of hydraulics suggests
		  that these compounds are influenced by hydrodynamic
		  effects. It is known that since the wave celerity is higher
		  than the flow velocity of the water, the increase of flow
		  rate induced through rain runoff is recognised earlier at a
		  certain downstream section of the combined sewer than the
		  concentration increase of typical rain-water compounds
		  originating from surface wash-off. This description implies
		  that the wave front is formed from the fluid that was
		  present in the sewer before the flow rate increased, that
		  is the sewage! By means of measurements and numerical
		  simulations, it is shown that this effect may cause a
		  significant impact of dissolved compounds on the receiving
		  water, when a combined sewer overflow occurs, and also on
		  the wastewater treatment plant when the sewer network is
		  flat and catchment area is big.},

  abstract	= {Summary Constructed wetlands are now commonly used to
		  control polluted urban stormwater discharges. A laboratory
		  study was conducted to investigate the treatment of solids
		  in these systems. Three mesocosm stormwater wetlands
		  (vegetated with a well-established canopy of different
		  densities) and one mesocosm non-vegetated pond were used,
		  all sized to achieve particle fall number (Nf, a ratio
		  between the times of the particle travel in horizontal and
		  vertical directions) and Particle Shear Velocity Reynolds
		  Number, Re*, which are reflective of full-scale systems.
		  The mesocosm vegetated systems had also similar turbulent
		  Reynolds Numbers (ReT) to those funds in full-scale
		  systems. Ten groups of steady-state experiments were
		  carried out, all with different hydraulic loadings and
		  sediment inflow concentrations (also maintained within the
		  ranges found in real systems during wet weather). Samples
		  were taken along the mesocosms and analysed for Total
		  Suspended Solids concentrations (TSS) and Particle Size
		  Distribution (PSD). It was found that both Re* and ReT do
		  not significantly influence the trapping of sediments, and
		  therefore the particle re-suspension induced by water flow
		  is not important for sedimentation in constructed
		  stormwater wetlands. Vegetation density was found not to be
		  an important factor, while particle diameter, and flow
		  characteristics (e.g., flow rate and velocity) do influence
		  trapping efficiency of particles. It was concluded that
		  sediment trapping correlates strongly with particle fall
		  number, Nf, and therefore can be explained by this single
		  non-dimensional number. A simple non-linear two-parameter
		  regression model is proposed for prediction of particle
		  trapping efficiency in constructed stormwater wetlands.
		  However, further work is needed before the method can be
		  used in practice. The aim of the ongoing work is to test
		  whether the proposed model could be used across a number of
		  real stormwater constructed wetlands without any further
		  calibration. The data collected from a number of stormwater
		  treatment systems in Melbourne, Australia, will be used in
		  this study.},

		  This article highlights the advantages and limitations of

  abstract	= {Meshless methods are getting more and more popular in
		  order to numerically simulate physical phenomena where an
		  interface appears and plays an important role. Thanks to
		  its fully Lagrangian formalism, the smoothed particle
		  hydrodynamics method (SPH) is hence well suited to simulate
		  free surface flows. The Pelton turbine is an hydraulic
		  turbomachinery whose flow is challenging to simulate
		  because of the complex rotating geometry, the free surface
		  and the interaction between the runner and the casing. The
		  work presented here aims at adapting SPH to simulate such a
		  flow.The standard SPH model has first been successfully
		  used to prove the capacity of the method in order to
		  simulate flows in Pelton turbines. As the prediction of the
		  pressure field on the bucket's surface is a key issue, a
		  new simple model for the treatment of solid boundary
		  conditions is proposed. Simulations of industrial test
		  cases, including a complete rotating runner, are finally

		  widely used to identify and understand the level of
		  pollution in urban stormwater systems, these data are often
		  used without due consideration of the inherent
		  uncertainties contained within these measurements. This
		  study focuses on the uncertainties associated with the
		  monitored levels of Escherichia coli, a common microbial
		  indicator, in urban stormwater. Four sites located in
		  Melbourne, Australia, were used to assess the uncertainty
		  of six stormwater flow and E. coli variables: (1) discrete
		  E. coli concentration, (2) stormwater flow rate, (3)
		  stormwater event volume, (4) event mean concentration (EMC)
		  of E. coli (i.e. a flow-weighted average of an event's E.
		  coli concentrations), (5) E. coli load for each measured
		  event, and (6) site mean E. coli concentration (SMC) (i.e.
		  a volume-weighted average of the E. coli EMCs).
		  Uncertainties of discrete E. coli samples were greater than
		  30%, while the uncertainty in stormwater flow measurements
		  averaged greater than 97%, mainly due to the high
		  uncertainties in measurements of very low flows.
		  Propagation of these uncertainties, through their
		  respective formulas, found that E. coli EMC uncertainties
		  varied between 10% and 52% and that uncertainties relating
		  to SMC estimates ranged from 35% to 55%. These results show
		  the importance of considering uncertainty when using
		  monitored data sets for any application, including those
		  relating to stormwater management decisions. Suggestions
		  are made about how to increase the accuracies of E. coli
		  monitoring in urban stormwater and how to balance the
		  different sources of uncertainties so that the overall
		  combined uncertainties are minimised while keeping costs at
		  a minimum.},

		  methodology is used for model calibration, testing and

		  California. Monte Carlo simulation is used to randomly

		  calibration period encompassing variable climatic and
		  wildfire conditions, from which behavioural (acceptable)
		  MIKE SHE parameter sets are identified and 5% and 95%
		  uncertainty bounds for monthly streamflow are calculated.
		  This group of behavioural parameter sets is subsequently
		  used to predict streamflow and to construct uncertainty
		  bounds for a 12-year test period with climatic and fire
		  characteristics different from those of the calibration
		  period. More than two-thirds of the observations in each
		  period fell within the corresponding uncertainty bounds,
		  suggesting a similar level of model performance in the
		  calibration and test periods. Prediction errors (i.e.
		  observations falling outside the uncertainty bounds) were
		  generally associated with large rainfall and wildfire
		  events and are indicative of deficiencies in model
		  structure, uncertainty in input data, and/or errors in
		  observed streamflow. The effect of uncertainty in remote
		  sensing-based LAI model inputs on the uncertainty
		  associated with MIKE SHE streamflow predictions receives
		  special attention in this work due to the fire-prone nature
		  of the study area and the increasing use of remotely sensed
		  LAI estimates in distributed hydrological modelling
		  applications. Results from MIKE SHE simulations for seven
		  LAI input scenarios (including the baseline LAI sequence
		  used in the model calibration and testing phase of this
		  study) indicate that differences in predictive uncertainty
		  between scenarios are usually less than Â±10%. This is
		  evidence that the baseline LAI trajectory is generally
		  appropriate for distributed hydrological modelling of
		  chaparral catchments.},

  abstract	= {Fire is a primary agent of landcover transformation in
		  California semi-arid shrubland watersheds, however few
		  studies have examined the impacts of fire and post-fire
		  succession on streamflow dynamics in these basins. While it
		  may seem intuitive that larger fires will have a greater
		  impact on streamflow response than smaller fires in these
		  watersheds, the nature of these relationships has not been
		  determined. The effects of fire size on seasonal and annual
		  streamflow responses were investigated for a medium-sized
		  basin in central California using a modified version of the
		  MIKE SHE model which had been previously calibrated and
		  tested for this watershed using the Generalized Likelihood
		  Uncertainty Estimation methodology. Model simulations were
		  made for two contrasting periods, wet and dry, in order to
		  assess whether fire size effects varied with weather
		  regime. Results indicated that seasonal and annual
		  streamflow response increased nearly linearly with fire
		  size in a given year under both regimes. Annual flow
		  response was generally higher in wetter years for both
		  weather regimes, however a clear trend was confounded by
		  the effect of stand age. These results expand our
		  understanding of the effects of fire size on hydrologic
		  response in chaparral watersheds, but it is important to
		  note that the majority of model predictions were largely
		  indistinguishable from the predictive uncertainty
		  associated with the calibrated model--a key finding that
		  highlights the importance of analyzing hydrologic
		  predictions for altered landcover conditions in the context
		  of model uncertainty. Future work is needed to examine how
		  alternative decisions (e.g., different likelihood measures)
		  may influence GLUE-based MIKE SHE streamflow predictions
		  following different size fires, and how the effect of fire
		  size on streamflow varies with other factors such as fire

		  years. The gauges are separated by one to 300 km and cover
		  an area of 43,000 km2. Significant geographical variations
		  of extreme rainfall characteristics have been observed.
		  Part of these variations can be explained by correlation
		  with the mean annual rainfall and the existence of a
		  metropolitan effect in the Greater Copenhagen area. The
		  remaining variation may be attributed to sampling errors
		  and small-scale spatial variations close to the gauges.
		  Engineering methodologies all require rain data of some
		  kind, ranging from design storms based on idf-curves for
		  use in simple calculations to high-resolution time series
		  for use in detailed simulation studies. A comprehensive
		  regional analysis was carried out to account for the
		  geographical variation and to improve estimation for large
		  return periods exceeding the actual length of the measured
		  time series. Ideally, rainfall data used as input to urban
		  drainage calculations should always be based on regional
		  rain information. Regional design storms can be made
		  readily available based on theory developed in this study.
		  However, a satisfactory framework for generating synthetic
		  rain series from regional rain information is not yet
		  available. Thus, there will still be a need for using
		  historical rain series in the near future. To improve the
		  basis for choosing representative historical rain series
		  all the Danish gauges have been classified according to
		  their deviations from the regional distribution.},

  abstract	= {The harvesting of urban stormwater to supply non-potable
		  water demands is emerging as a viable option, amongst
		  others, as a means to augment increasingly stressed urban
		  water supply systems. This paper investigates the
		  sensitivity of an urban stormwater harvesting system's
		  capacity-yield-reliability relationship to variations in
		  the behaviour modelling method used, focusing on the
		  storage and demand components of a single reservoir system.
		  The aim is to enhance our understanding of the appropriate
		  computational method for assessing such volumetric
		  reliability/storage capacity relationships. Four reference
		  scenarios were developed, based on two different climates
		  and two different water demand patterns. A sensitivity
		  analysis was conducted, which considered the following
		  computational, storage and demand parameters:
		  yield-spillage order, modelling time-step, length of
		  rainfall record, initial storage volume, open/closed
		  storage surface, dead storage volume, diurnal and weekly
		  pattern of water demand, and inter-annual variability of
		  seasonal water demand. It was found that several parameters
		  had an insignificant impact on the estimation of volumetric
		  reliability for the scenarios tested, whilst the three most
		  significant parameters were: length of rainfall record,
		  inter-annual variability of seasonal demand, and storage
		  surface type. Recommendations about the minimum length of
		  rainfall record used and the inclusion of both the
		  inter-annual variability of seasonal demand and net
		  evaporative losses in the case of an open store are made.},

  abstract	= " The tensile instability in smoothed particle
		  hydrodynamics results in a clustering of smoothed particle
		  hydrodynamics (SPH) particles. The clustering is
		  particularly noticeable in materials which have an equation
		  of state which can give rise to negative pressures, but it
		  can occur in gases where the pressure is always positive
		  and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems. It is a
		  particular problem in solid body computations where the
		  instability may corrupt physical fragmentation by numerical
		  fragmentation which, in some cases, is so severe that the
		  dynamics of the system is completely wrong. In this paper
		  it is shown how the instability can be removed by using an
		  artificial stress which, in the case of fluids, is an
		  artificial pressure. The method is analyzed by examining
		  the dispersion relation for small oscillations in a fluid
		  with a stiff equation of state. The short and long
		  wavelength limits of the dispersion relation indicate
		  appropriate parameters for the artificial pressure and,
		  with these parameters, the errors in the long wavelength
		  limit are small. Numerical studies of the dispersion
		  relation for a wide range of parameters confirm the
		  approximate analytical results for the dispersion relation.
		  Applications to several test problems show that the
		  artificial stress works effectively. These problems include
		  the evolution of a region with negative pressure, extreme
		  expansion in one dimension, and the collision of rubber
		  cylinders. To study this latter problem the artificial
		  pressure is generalized to an artificial stress. The
		  results agree well with the calculations of other stable
		  codes. "

		  were retrieved from radar data for several thunderstorms

		  dense rain gauge network. For an extreme case study in a
		  semi-arid watershed, rain cells were derived and fed as
		  input into a hydrological model to compute runoff response.
		  A major factor in this event was found to be a single
		  intense rain cell (out of the five cells decomposed from
		  the storm). The path of this cell near watershed
		  tributaries and toward the outlet enhanced generation of
		  high flow. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis to cell
		  characteristics indicated that peak discharge could be a

		  flooding involves decisions regarding the choice of model
		  and goal of the modeling exercise, expressed by some
		  measure of performance. This paper shows how the
		  subjectivity in the choices of performance measures and
		  observation sets used for model calibration inevitably
		  results in variability in the estimation of flood hazard.
		  We compare the predictions of a 2D flood inundation model
		  obtained using different global and local evaluation
		  criteria. It is shown that traditional area averaging
		  performance measures are inadequate in the face of model
		  imperfection, especially when such models are calibrated
		  for flood hazard studies. In this study we include flood
		  risk weighting into the performance measure of the model.
		  This allows us to calibrate the model to places that are
		  important, e.g. location of houses. The quantification of
		  the importance of places requires the necessity of engaging
		  stakeholders into the model calibration process.},

  abstract	= {Landslides are a serious concern in steepland areas where
		  intensive storms are common. The level of landslide hazard
		  is not only dependent on storm and land physical
		  attributes, human activities, especially agriculture
		  practices, are also important considerations. Hurricane
		  Mitch was one of the strongest hurricanes of the 20th
		  century; it generated intense rain that triggered
		  widespread landslides and flooding throughout Honduras and
		  Nicaragua. The objective of this study was to develop and
		  test a heuristic approach for predicting spatial
		  distribution of landslide hazard. Four variables, slope,
		  aspect, stream proximity, and land cover type, generated
		  from available topography and remote sensing data, were
		  used in the model. This model was developed and verified in
		  southern Honduras based on data from the Namasigue
		  watershed and validated in the adjacent El Triunfo
		  watershed. Results of GIS analyses showed that the
		  likelihood of landslide was significantly influenced by
		  slope and land cover. As slope increased, the percentage of
		  land affected by landslides, when the soils were saturated,
		  increased sharply on land used for crop production,
		  indicating that agricultural activity and the associated
		  removal of deep-rooted permanent vegetation increased the
		  landslide hazard on steep sites. Consequently, sites
		  covered by shrub fallow and forests had relatively low
		  incidence of landslides regardless of the topographic
		  features. The model was effective in predicting landslide
		  hazard and generating landslide hazard maps; this model has
		  been found to be a useful aid for soil and water
		  conservation organizations in the region to target
		  conservation investment.},

		  control of the urine waste stream. Based on measured data a
		  stochastic model is developed that is capable of providing
		  stochastic information on the frequency, timing, and volume
		  of urine releases into each single toilet in a catchment.
		  It is then demonstrated in a virtual case study that the
		  design of the human wastewater stream in terms of urine
		  content can (1) reduce the ammonia peak loads at dry
		  weather flow conditions by approx. 30% (which could
		  effectively substitute the expansion of wastewater
		  treatment plants) and (2) reduce the impact of combined
		  sewer overflows on the aquatic environment. With respect to
		  the latter a reduction of more than 50% is demonstrated in
		  terms of annual urine volume released via the overflow.},

  abstract	= {Biofiltration systems use vegetation to improve efficiency
		  of pollutant removal from stormwater, but little is known
		  of how plants vary in their capacity to improve biofilter
		  effectiveness. We used a pot trial of 20 Australian species
		  to investigate how species vary in the removal of
		  pollutants from semisynthetic stormwater passing through a
		  soil filter medium. Effluent levels of total suspended
		  solids (TSS), Al, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn were similarly low for
		  vegetated and non-vegetated soils, with reduction to <1-12%
		  of levels in the stormwater input. N and P effluent
		  concentrations were generally lower from vegetated than
		  non-vegetated soils, but total N increased on average in
		  effluent of both vegetated and non-vegetated soils relative
		  to stormwater input. Effluent concentrations varied
		  2-4-fold among species for TSS, total N and P, total
		  dissolved N (TDN), organic nitrogen and Cu, to more than
		  20-fold for NOx, NH4+, Mn, Pb and Fe. Species also varied
		  markedly in pollutant removal per root mass (a means of
		  standardising for plant size), with 18-50-fold variation
		  among species in effluent concentrations of total P and N,
		  TDN and organic N, to >150-fold variation in NOx and NH4+.
		  Hence, choice of plant species may have marked effects on
		  biofilter effectiveness.},

		  most important parameters for evaluating wet-weather
		  pollution in urban sanitation systems. In fact, pollutants
		  such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
		  (PAHs), phosphorous and organic compounds are adsorbed onto
		  these particles so that a high TSS load indicates the
		  potential impact on the receiving waters. In this paper, a
		  stochastic model is proposed to estimate the TSS load and
		  its dynamics during rain events. Information on the various
		  simulated processes was extracted from different studies of
		  TSS in urban areas. The model thus predicts the probability
		  of TSS loads arising from combined sewer overflows (CSOs)
		  in combined sewer systems as well as from stormwater in
		  separate sewer systems in addition to the amount of TSS
		  retained in treatment devices in both sewer systems. The
		  results of this TSS model illustrate the potential of the
		  stochastic modeling approach for assessing environmental

		  drainage call for even better rain data: ideally a long
		  data series (e.g. 20 years or more) with 1 min time
		  resolution, 1 km2 spatial resolution, and time
		  synchronization errors below 1 min should be available. For
		  some applications these requirements might be relaxed,
		  though. It appears that only in a joint effort,

		  able to supply this data. Data sources can be historical
		  paper chart records, state-of-the-art automatic rain
		  gauges, and radar which is attractive because it provides a
		  high spatial resolution. As the next decades will be
		  characterized by extremely high expenditures for sewer
		  renovation in all industrialized countries, the rain data
		  base to be used for proper re-dimensioning of these systems
		  needs to be much improved.},

		  rainfall estimators (radar data and raingauge networks of

		  simulated runoff evaluated as a function of rainfall type,
		  catchment type and catchment scale. An index of spatial
		  variability is defined, based on the difference between the
		  reference rainfall (defined by the full raingauge network)
		  and alternative rainfall estimators. A modified
		  Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency criterion measures the
		  performance of the simulated runoff with respect to
		  reference simulated runoff. Results show a complex picture.
		  The dominant effect is the spatial variability of the
		  rainfall. No clear pattern emerges as a function of
		  catchment scale, or response time, except that the impact
		  of spatial variability is damped at the whole catchment
		  scale. The sensitivity to spatial rainfall is enhanced on
		  urbanised catchments.},

		  in choosing synchronization operations greatly simplifies
		  the task of designing highly concurrent programs.
		  Unfortunately, existing hardware is inflexible and is at
		  best on the level of a {LoadâLinked/StoreâConditional}
		  operation on a single word. Building on the hardware based
		  transactional synchronization methodology of Herlihy and
		  Moss, we offer software transactional memory {(STM),} a
		  novel software method for supporting flexible transactional
		  programming of synchronization operations. {STM} is
		  non-blocking, and can be implemented on existing machines
		  using only a {LoadâLinked/StoreâConditional} operation.
		  We use {STM} to provide a general highly concurrent method
		  for translating sequential object implementations to
		  non-blocking ones based on implementing a k-word
		  compare\&swap {STM-transaction.} Empirical evidence
		  collected on simulated multiprocessor architectures shows
		  that our method always outperforms the non-blocking
		  translation methods in the style of Barnes, and outperforms
		  Herlihyâs translation method for sufficiently large
		  numbers of processors. The key to the efficiency of our
		  software-transactional approach is that unlike Barnes style
		  methods, it is not based on a costly ârecursive
		  helpingâ policy. },

		  Two different methods were used for sensitivity analyses of

		  meso-scale Brugga basin (40Â km2) and the sub-basin St

		  applied using 400 different parameter sets, which were
		  generated by Monte Carlo simulations using latin hypercube
		  sampling. The regional sensitivity analysis (RSA) allowed
		  determining the most significant parameters for the
		  complete simulation periods using a graphical method. The
		  results of the regression-based sensitivity analysis were
		  more detailed and complex. The temporal variability of the
		  simulation sensitivity could be observed continuously and
		  the significance of the parameters could be determined in a

		  in other catchments became obvious. The analysis of the
		  temporal course of the simulation sensitivity to parameter
		  values in conjunction with simulated and measured
		  additional data sets (precipitation, temperature, reservoir
		  volumes etc.) gave further insight into the internal model

		  Whilst it is evident that clogging determines the design

		  understanding of the clogging process is currently very
		  limited. A laboratory study was therefore undertaken to
		  better understand physical clogging processes, with the
		  ultimate aim of developing a clogging model for stormwater

		  one-dimensional (1-D) experiments conducted on a gravel
		  filter column. Physical clogging was studied under both
		  constant and variable water levels, and for different
		  sediment inflow concentrations. It was found that a
		  clogging layer forms at the interface between the filter
		  and underlying soil, irrespective of the inflow regime of
		  both water and sediment. It was also found that clogging is
		  much slower if the water level is kept at a constant level
		  than if it varies within the column, due to formation of a
		  sediment plug that [`]shelters' the filter/soil interface.
		  Most importantly it was shown that physical clogging is
		  mainly caused by migration of sediment particles less than
		  6Â [mu]m in diameter. A simple regression model was
		  proposed and tested for the prediction of clogging due to
		  stormwater sediment.},

		  Likelihoods. Informal Likelihoods are used to characterise
		  desirable features in the relationship between the model
		  output and corresponding observed data. A number of common
		  performance criteria are considered as Informal
		  Likelihoods. Analytical results and a simulation indicate
		  all of the performance criteria considered as Informal
		  Likelihoods in this paper have one or more properties which
		  may be considered undesirable, but may perform no less well
		  in conditioning model parameters than formal likelihoods
		  for which the assumptions are only mildly incorrect.},

  abstract	= {The paper deals with the relationship between the temporal
		  occurrence of landslides and climatic changes in the
		  Italian Dolomites since the Late glacial. After an
		  introduction on the state of the art, with particular
		  reference to the Alpine region, the results of recent
		  investigations in the two study sites are illustrated. At
		  Cortina d'Ampezzo, several landslides were dated mainly by
		  the radiocarbon method. The most ancient landslide event
		  there involved large rock slides, which affected the
		  dolomitic slopes following the withdrawal of glaciers after
		  the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and also slides and flows
		  mainly occurring in pelitic materials of the valley floors
		  (from 13,000 to 10,000 cal BP). A later series of flows
		  occurred between 5500 and 2500 cal BP. In the Upper Badia
		  Valley (Alta Badia), the most ancient events go back to
		  10,000 and 9000 cal BP, and correspond with earth flows
		  that followed vast rotational slides affecting the bedrock
		  up to a depth of about 50 m. More recent earth flows,
		  involving more modest amounts of material, took place
		  between 6500 and 2300 cal BP. By analysing the dates from
		  the two study areas, it was possible to correlate the
		  recorded increase of landslide activity with the climatic
		  changes occurring at the boundary between the Late glacial
		  and the Holocene and between the Atlantic and the
		  Subboreal, and to compare the results with those derived
		  from other European regions. The types and causes of
		  landslides taking place in these two periods were
		  substantially different, reflecting the different
		  morphoclimatic conditions that existed in the two areas
		  when these mass movements were triggered. Finally,
		  notwithstanding the importance of non-climatic causes, such
		  as geological-structural factors and possible human
		  influences, it is concluded that many of the dated
		  landslides can be considered as indicators of climatic
		  change.},

		  the IAWQ Activated Sludge Model (ASM) No. 1, the Task Group
		  proposes to develop improved conversion models for
		  inclusion in a river water quality model. The model should
		  describe the cycling of oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in

		  ASM to support the development of integrated emission
		  reduction strategies. The model should be particularly well
		  suited to handle problems characterized by significant
		  temporal and spatial influences (e.g. CSOs and NPSs). It
		  should serve for research, education, improved
		  communication, knowledge transfer, regulatory applications
		  such as catchment planning, and improved data collection.
		  Anticipated results of the Task Group effort include: (i)
		  standardized conversion sub-models; (ii) a decision support
		  tool to guide model construction and usage; and (iii) case
		  study applications. The model development, which is not
		  intended to result in a software product, is intended to be
		  an open-ended and flexible process to encourage the

		  conducted. Applying the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty
		  Estimation (GLUE) methodology the model is conditioned on
		  observation time series from two flow gauges as well as the
		  occurrence of combined sewer overflow. The GLUE methodology
		  is used to test different conceptual setups in order to
		  determine if one model setup gives a better goodness of fit
		  conditional on the observations than the other. Moreover,
		  different methodological investigations of GLUE are
		  conducted in order to test if the uncertainty analysis is
		  unambiguous. It is shown that the GLUE methodology is very
		  applicable in uncertainty analysis of this application of
		  an urban drainage model, although it was shown to be quite
		  difficult to get good fits of the whole time series.},

  pages		= {48 - 59},
  number	= {1-4},
  abstract	= {The spatial rainfall variability can have a large effect
		  on the prediction of discharges in urban drainage systems.
		  Areal rainfall correction coefficients are often used to
		  cope with this problem. This paper makes a clear
		  distinction between two types of areal correction
		  coefficients: one for correction of historical data at
		  given time moments and one for rainfall at given return
		  period levels. The first type can be used within
		  applications of calibration of models of urban drainage
		  systems, while the second type is needed for design
		  purposes. The second type is most often found in the
		  literature and referred to as the areal reduction factors.
		  This paper shows that for small catchment areas and limited
		  rainfall intensities, they also may reflect an increase and
		  not always a reduction. Therefore, they are called more
		  generally areal correction coefficients in this paper. Both
		  types of coefficients were derived for the Flanders region
		  in Belgium. They were based on simulations with a spatial
		  rainfall generator. The areal correction coefficients were
		  considered dependent on the size of the catchment, the
		  rainfall aggregation level, and the rainfall intensity
		  (linked to the return period through IDF-relationships).
		  The dependencies in time and space make a correct
		  application of correction coefficients to the combined
		  hydrologic-hydrodynamic modelling of urban drainage systems
		  and the design of these systems not obvious, as pointed out
		  by the paper.},

		  problem in hydrological models, especially for distributed
		  models. Therefore, methods to reduce the number of
		  parameters via sensitivity analysis are important for the
		  efficient use of these models. This paper describes a novel
		  sampling strategy that is a combination of latin-hypercube
		  and one-factor-at-a-time sampling that allows a global
		  sensitivity analysis for a long list of parameters with
		  only a limited number of model runs. The method is
		  illustrated with an application of the water flow and water
		  quality parameters of the distributed water quality program
		  SWAT, considering flow, suspended sediment, total nitrogen,
		  total phosphorus, nitrate and ammonia outputs at several
		  locations in the Upper North Bosque River catchment in
		  Texas and the Sandusky River catchment in Ohio. The
		  application indicates that the methodology works
		  successfully. The results also show that hydrologic
		  parameters are dominant in controlling water quality
		  predictions. Finally, the sensitivity results are not
		  transferable between basins and thus the analysis needs to
		  be conducted separately for each study catchment.},

  abstract	= {Rainfall is characterized by high variability both in
		  space and time. Despite continuous technological progress,
		  the available instruments that are used to measure rainfall
		  across several spatio-temporal scales remain inaccurate. To
		  remedy this situation, scaling relationships of spatial
		  rainfall offer the potential to link the observed or
		  predicted precipitation quantities at one scale to those of
		  interest at other scales. This paper focuses on the
		  estimation of the spatial rainfall scaling functions.
		  Standard scaling analysis constructed by means of the
		  ordinary least squares method often violates such basic
		  assumptions implicit in its use and interpretation as
		  homoschedasticity, independence, and normality of the
		  errors. Consequently, the authors consider alternative
		  regression frameworks i.e. bootstrapping regression, semi
		  parametric linear model, and multilevel normal linear model
		  to show how these different approaches exert a significant
		  impact on the multifractal analysis of radar rainfall. In
		  addition, the uncertainties associated with the
		  construction of the scaling function due solely to the
		  regression procedure are quantified. The radar data come
		  from the polarimetric C-band weather radar located in Rome,
		  Italy, and the scaling properties are computed for a square
		  domain centred on the radar site with a side length of
		  128Â km and a finest resolution of 1Â km2.},

		  reject-water and the quick loss of alkalinity during
		  nitrification makes a reliable control of the process
		  necessary. A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) with an

		  control system for discontinuous treatment of reject-water
		  has been extensively tested and optimised in full-scale

		  pH-value was developed to keep the bicarbonate
		  concentration within an optimum range. At the WWTP Strass

  abstract	= {It is clear from the fundamental biochemical processes
		  that nitrification of extremely concentrated ammonia loads
		  requires--among others--(1) sufficient alkalinity to buffer
		  acidification and (2) bicarbonate as the substrate for the
		  autotrophic biomass. However, at low pH values the aeration
		  process causes CO2 stripping and consequently a decrease of
		  the available inorganic carbon. In order to analyse such
		  complex interactions, we suggest in this paper an enhanced
		  version of the widely acknowledged IWA (formerly IAWQ)
		  activated sludge models. These model enlargements comprise
		  an ion-balance for the calculation of the pH value and of
		  dissociation species, a balance of inorganic carbon and a
		  more detailed description of the relevant N-elimination
		  processes and their inhibitions. The model was successfully
		  employed to optimise a treatment strategy for
		  rejection-water and landfill leachate (500-2000Â mg
		  ammonia-NÂ l-1, COD/N ratio of 0.25-4). Detailed data from
		  two full-scale rejection-water treatment plants were used
		  for systems identification, model calibration and
		  validation. The results suggest that inhibition and
		  limitation by nitrous acid (HNO2) and unionised ammonia
		  (NH3) have often been overestimated. In this investigation
		  the bicarbonate concentration proved to be crucial for the
		  process. The optimisation of the bicarbonate concentration
		  in the reactor could improve the nitrozation rate up to

		  to the integrated modelling of urban wastewater systems.
		  The aim was to develop a screening procedure to establish
		  the real-time control potential (RTC) of an urban catchment
		  without the necessity of carrying out a detailed modelling
		  assessment procedure. SYNOPSIS was applied to a series of
		  `related' catchments (with and without real-time control)
		  that were similar in most respects but had differences in
		  key parameters such as total storage volume and river
		  dilution. It was found feasible to linearly regress control
		  potential based on a river minimum dissolved oxygen
		  concentration with the magnitude of these parameters.
		  Extending the application of the procedure showed that
		  optimisation for DO performance did not necessarily reduce
		  river ammonia concentrations and could in fact increase
		  them. Widening the parameter space was shown to reduce the
		  simplicity of the procedure and the correlation
		  coefficients in the regressions. The procedure was
		  successfully applied to a range of real catchments and
		  managed to identify sites with existing RTC as having high
		  potential.},

  abstract	= {In urban hydrology the continuously recorded rainfall data
		  is digitized into constant rain intensity with time steps
		  between 1 min and 1 h. If the time steps are chosen too
		  large, short duration peak rainfall intensities are
		  filtered. As a consequence peak flow rates are
		  underestimated. This error is amplified if overflow volumes
		  from combined sewer systems are calculated. This paper
		  presents a method to predict errors of calculated mean
		  annual overflow volume due to coarse temporal resolution of
		  rainfall data that is used as input to rainfall-runoff
		  models. Errors are quantified by comparison of overflow
		  volumes based on rain data series with different temporal
		  resolution. Two rain data series (Fehraltorf/Switzerland
		  and Odense/Denmark) are used together with synthetic
		  combined sewer systems to compute errors of mean annual
		  overflow volume as a function of: - - the time resolution
		  of the rain data;- - the critical flow of an overflow
		  weir;- - the storage volume of an overflow tank; and- - the
		  inflow to an overflow weir or tank. The procedure is
		  verified for the sewer system of Fehraltorf, Switzerland,
		  located in the vicinity of Z\"{u}rich, using local rainfall
		  data. However, results showed that prediction of overflow
		  errors due to rain data resolution in Fehraltorf using the
		  Danish rainfall data is more difficult. Apparently, the
		  pattern of the temporal rainfall variation of the two data
		  series are too different to derive error prediction rules
		  that are generally applicable for all rainfall regimes.},
